I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning problems into simple, scalable
solutions. Over the last 20+ years, I’ve worked across developer platforms,
cloud infrastructure, and product engineering in many industries—shipping
production systems, raising reliability and performance, and helping teams
deliver with confidence.

My role often sits at the intersection of deep technical work and leadership:
setting technical direction, aligning stakeholders, and coaching engineers as
they grow. I care a lot about strong engineering fundamentals, clear designs,
pragmatic tradeoffs, and systems that are easy to operate.

Away from the keyboard, I'm a husband, dog dad, avid Avalanche fan, and
guitarist.
